# Tree - Learning Objectives

## Overview
Trees are hierarchical data structures essential for many algorithms and real-world applications like file systems and databases.

## Learning Objectives

### 1. Tree Data Structure Mastery
- Understand tree terminology (root, node, leaf, depth, height)
- Learn binary tree properties and structure
- Master tree node representation
- Understand complete, full, and perfect trees

### 2. Tree Traversal Methods
- Master inorder traversal (left, root, right)
- Master preorder traversal (root, left, right)
- Master postorder traversal (left, right, root)
- Master level order traversal (BFS)

### 3. Recursive vs Iterative Traversal
- Implement all traversals recursively
- Implement all traversals iteratively with stack
- Understand Morris traversal (O(1) space)
- Practice converting between approaches

### 4. Tree Construction and Properties
- Construct tree from traversals
- Calculate tree properties (depth, height, size)
- Check tree properties (balanced, complete)
- Find lowest common ancestor

## Python-Specific Notes
- Define TreeNode class with val, left, right
- Use None for empty nodes
- Recursive solutions are often cleaner
- Use deque for level-order traversal

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Implement all traversal methods (recursive and iterative)
- [ ] Calculate tree depth, height, and size
- [ ] Check if tree is balanced
- [ ] Find lowest common ancestor
- [ ] Serialize and deserialize binary tree
