# BST (Binary Search Tree) - Learning Objectives

## Overview
Binary Search Tree is a sorted binary tree where left subtree values < root < right subtree values. BST enables efficient search, insert, and delete operations.

## Learning Objectives

### 1. BST Properties
- Understand BST property (left < root < right)
- Learn how BST enables efficient operations
- Master in-order traversal gives sorted output
- Understand BST vs sorted array tradeoffs

### 2. BST Operations
- Master search operation (O(h) time)
- Learn insert operation
- Master delete operation (3 cases)
- Understand successor/predecessor finding

### 3. Validation and Conversion
- Learn to validate BST
- Convert sorted array to balanced BST
- Convert BST to sorted doubly linked list
- Understand floor and ceil operations

### 4. BST Applications
- Implement BST iterator
- Find kth smallest element
- Solve range sum problems
- Handle two-sum in BST

## Python-Specific Notes
- TreeNode class same as binary tree
- In-order traversal yields sorted values
- Use iterative approach for BST iterator
- Track previous value for validation

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Implement search, insert, delete in BST
- [ ] Validate if tree is valid BST
- [ ] Find kth smallest element
- [ ] Convert sorted array to BST
- [ ] Implement BST iterator
