# String - Learning Objectives

## Overview
Strings are sequences of characters and are fundamental to coding interviews. String manipulation skills are essential for many real-world applications.

## Learning Objectives

### 1. String Fundamentals
- Understand string immutability in Python
- Learn Python string methods and their time complexities
- Master string slicing and indexing
- Understand Unicode and character encoding

### 2. Pattern Matching Techniques
- Learn brute force pattern matching
- Understand KMP algorithm for efficient pattern matching
- Master Rabin-Karp rolling hash technique
- Learn Z-algorithm for pattern matching

### 3. String Encoding/Decoding
- Understand common encoding schemes
- Learn to implement serialization/deserialization
- Practice run-length encoding
- Master string compression techniques

### 4. Palindrome Problems
- Learn palindrome detection techniques
- Master expand-around-center approach
- Understand Manacher's algorithm for longest palindrome
- Practice palindrome partitioning

### 5. Substring Problems
- Master sliding window for substring problems
- Learn to find longest/shortest substring with constraints
- Understand anagram detection
- Practice minimum window substring problems

## Python-Specific Notes
- Strings are immutable - concatenation creates new strings
- Use `join()` for efficient string concatenation
- `ord()` converts char to ASCII, `chr()` converts ASCII to char
- Use f-strings for formatting: `f"Hello {name}"`
- String methods: `split()`, `strip()`, `lower()`, `upper()`, `isalnum()`

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Solve string problems efficiently without unnecessary string copies
- [ ] Implement pattern matching algorithms
- [ ] Handle palindrome problems with optimal solutions
- [ ] Apply sliding window to substring problems
- [ ] Encode and decode strings correctly
