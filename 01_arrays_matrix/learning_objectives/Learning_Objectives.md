# Arrays & Matrix - Learning Objectives

## Overview
Arrays are the most fundamental data structure in programming. Mastering array manipulation is essential for coding interviews.

## Learning Objectives

### 1. Array Fundamentals
- Understand array indexing and memory layout
- Learn how arrays are stored in contiguous memory locations
- Understand time complexity of array operations (access: O(1), insertion/deletion: O(n))
- Master Python list operations and their complexities

### 2. Two Pointers Technique
- Understand the two pointers pattern for array traversal
- Master opposite-end pointers (start and end converging)
- Learn fast-slow pointers for cycle detection and array modification
- Apply two pointers for sorted array problems

### 3. Sliding Window Technique
- Understand fixed-size sliding window
- Master variable-size sliding window
- Learn when to use sliding window vs other techniques
- Practice optimizing O(n²) to O(n) using sliding window

### 4. Matrix Operations
- Practice matrix traversal patterns (row-major, column-major)
- Understand 2D array indexing in Python
- Learn matrix rotation and transformation
- Master spiral traversal patterns

### 5. In-Place Modifications
- Understand space optimization through in-place operations
- Learn to modify arrays without extra space
- Master techniques for array rearrangement
- Handle edge cases in in-place modifications

## Python-Specific Notes
- Python lists are dynamic arrays with amortized O(1) append
- Use list comprehensions for concise array creation
- Remember slicing creates a copy: `arr[:]` vs `arr`
- Use `enumerate()` for index-value pairs
- Use `zip()` for iterating multiple arrays

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Solve array problems with O(n) time complexity
- [ ] Implement two pointers solutions confidently
- [ ] Apply sliding window to substring/subarray problems
- [ ] Rotate and traverse matrices efficiently
- [ ] Optimize space using in-place modifications
