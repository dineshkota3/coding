# Recursion - Learning Objectives

## Overview
Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself. It's essential for tree traversals, divide and conquer, and many interview problems.

## Learning Objectives

### 1. Recursive Thinking
- Understand when recursion is appropriate
- Learn to break problems into smaller subproblems
- Master the "leap of faith" in recursive solutions
- Recognize recursive patterns in problems

### 2. Base Case and Recursive Case
- Learn to identify base cases correctly
- Understand recursive case design
- Master handling multiple base cases
- Avoid infinite recursion

### 3. Call Stack Behavior
- Understand how recursion uses the call stack
- Learn about stack overflow
- Visualize recursion tree
- Understand recursion depth implications

### 4. Recursion vs Iteration
- Know when to use recursion vs iteration
- Understand time/space tradeoffs
- Learn tail recursion concept
- Practice converting between approaches

## Python-Specific Notes
- Default recursion limit is 1000
- `sys.setrecursionlimit()` to increase
- Recursion uses O(depth) stack space
- Python doesn't optimize tail recursion

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Solve classic recursive problems (factorial, Fibonacci)
- [ ] Implement recursive tree traversals
- [ ] Generate subsets and permutations recursively
- [ ] Understand and apply memoization
- [ ] Convert recursion to iteration when needed
