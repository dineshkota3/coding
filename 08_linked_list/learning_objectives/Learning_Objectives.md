# Linked List - Learning Objectives

## Overview
Linked lists are fundamental data structures where elements are connected via pointers. They test pointer manipulation skills.

## Learning Objectives

### 1. Linked List Fundamentals
- Understand node structure (value + next pointer)
- Learn singly vs doubly linked list
- Master pointer manipulation
- Understand memory allocation for nodes

### 2. Fast and Slow Pointer Technique
- Learn Floyd's cycle detection algorithm
- Master finding middle element
- Understand when to use fast-slow pointers
- Apply to palindrome detection

### 3. Dummy Node Technique
- Learn to use dummy head for edge cases
- Understand when dummy node simplifies code
- Master pointer manipulation with dummy
- Practice clean list manipulation

### 4. List Reversal and Merging
- Master iterative and recursive reversal
- Learn to reverse sublists
- Understand merging sorted lists
- Practice in-place modifications

## Python-Specific Notes
- Use class for node definition
- `node.next` for pointer access
- Handle `None` checks carefully
- Use dummy head: `dummy = ListNode(0)`

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Implement linked list from scratch
- [ ] Detect cycle using Floyd's algorithm
- [ ] Reverse linked list iteratively and recursively
- [ ] Find middle element and merge sorted lists
- [ ] Solve reorder list and palindrome problems
