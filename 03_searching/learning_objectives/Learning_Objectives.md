# Searching - Learning Objectives

## Overview
Searching algorithms are fundamental for finding elements efficiently. Binary search is the most important technique for sorted data.

## Learning Objectives

### 1. Binary Search Mastery
- Understand binary search intuition and logic
- Master the standard binary search implementation
- Learn to identify when binary search is applicable
- Understand time complexity O(log n)

### 2. Binary Search Variations
- Learn to find first occurrence (lower bound)
- Learn to find last occurrence (upper bound)
- Master search in rotated sorted arrays
- Understand binary search on answer pattern

### 3. Search Space Optimization
- Learn to reduce search space effectively
- Understand when to exclude left vs right half
- Master handling of edge cases
- Practice with various data structures

### 4. Binary Search on Answer
- Learn to apply binary search to optimization problems
- Understand the monotonic property requirement
- Practice with problems like sqrt(x), capacity problems

## Python-Specific Notes
- Use `bisect` module for binary search operations
- `bisect_left()`: Find insertion point for first occurrence
- `bisect_right()`: Find insertion point after last occurrence
- Integer overflow not an issue in Python

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Implement binary search from scratch
- [ ] Find first and last position of element
- [ ] Search in rotated sorted array
- [ ] Apply binary search on answer pattern
- [ ] Understand lower/upper bound concepts
